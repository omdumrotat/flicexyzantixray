# flicexyzantixray
- ok, the name seems MISLEADING when its hiding block at a y level not through fancy raytracing or pure ifyoucantseeitthenfakeoresforyou techniques (im looking at you orebfuscator and paper antixray engine mode 2 and 3). At best, this is only an anti base esp plugin.
- Hides blocks from Y ≤ 16 if the player is ≥ 31.0; very useful against freecam hacks (for real xray prevention you should check out raytraceantixray and use it alongside this)
